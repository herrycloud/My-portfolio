                      The X and O game, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
                      Players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols, X or O, with the objective of forming a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
                      The first player to achieve this wins the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This project is a web-based implementation of the X and O game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface where two players can take turns clicking on the available grid cells to place their symbols.
                      The game includes features such as detecting a win condition, preventing further moves after a win, and offering an option to start a new game.
